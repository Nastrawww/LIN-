STM32 as the Lin Master || Configure & Send Data
This is the 8th tutorial in the series on the UART peripheral of STM32 Microcontrollers. In this series we will cover different ways of transmitting and receiving data over the UART protocol. We will also see different UART modes available in the STM32 microcontrollers and how to use them.

This tutorial is the PART1 in the small series covering the Lin protocol. In today’s tutorial we will configure the STM32 as the lin master, prepare the the data to be transmitted over the linbus and send the data. There will be no slave involved and the data will be monitored via the logic analyzer.

Basically we will see if the data transmitted is recognized as a valid lin frame by the analyzer. later in the upcoming tutorials we will connect an actual slave device and try to communicate with it.

I will be covering the lin version 2.1 in this series. As the the specification manual, a typical lin frame is shown in the picture below.

The lin frame consists of the Header and the Response. The Header further contains the Break Field, the Sync Field and the Protected ID. The Response contains the Data bytes and the checksum byte.

Break
The break field is used to signal the beginning of a new frame. A break field is always generated by the master task (in the master node) and it shall be at least 13 nominal bit times of dominant value, followed by a break delimiter, as below.

Sync
Sync is a byte field with the data value 0x55 as shown in the image below.

Protected ID
A protected identifier field consists of two sub-fields: the frame identifier and the parity. Bits 0 to 5 are the frame identifier and bits 6 and 7 are the parity.

Six bits are reserved for the frame identifier, values in the range 0 to 63 can be used. The frame identifiers are split in three categories:

Values 0 to 59 (0x3B) are used for signal carrying frames
60 (0x3C) and 61 (0x3D) are used to carry diagnostic and configuration data
62 (0x3E) and 63 (0x3F) are reserved for future protocol enhancements
The parity is calculated on the frame identifier bits as shown below:

P0 = ID0 ⊕ ID1 ⊕ ID2 ⊕ ID4
P1 = ¬(ID1 ⊕ ID3 ⊕ ID4 ⊕ ID5)

Data
A frame carries between one and eight bytes of data. A data byte is transmitted as part of a byte field. For data entities longer than one byte, the entity LSB is contained in the byte sent first and the entity MSB in the byte sent last (little-endian).

Checksum
The last field of a frame is the checksum. The checksum contains the inverted eight bit sum with carry over all data bytes or all data bytes and the protected identifier. Checksum calculation over the data bytes and the protected identifier byte is called enhanced checksum and it is used for communication with LIN 2.x slaves. Use of classic or enhanced checksum is managed by the master node and it is determined per frame identifier; classic in communication with LIN 1.x slave nodes and enhanced in communication with LIN 2.x slave nodes.
A typical example of checksum calculation is shown below.
